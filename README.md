## Tools

[Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) is a managed, production-ready environment for running containerized applications.

[AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/aws-controllers-for-kubernetes-ack/) is a new tool that lets you directly manage AWS services from Kubernetes. ACK makes it simple to build scalable and highly-available Kubernetes applications that utilize AWS services.

[Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE)](https://www.oracle.com/cloud-native/container-engine-kubernetes/) is an Oracle-managed container orchestration service that can reduce the time and cost to build modern cloud native applications. Unlike most other vendors, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides Container Engine for Kubernetes as a free service that runs on higher-performance, lower-cost compute.

[Anthos](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/docs/concepts/overview) is a modern application management platform that provides a consistent development and operations experience for cloud and on-premises environments.

[Red Hat Openshift](https://www.openshift.com/) is a fully managed Kubernetes platform that provides a foundation for on-premises, hybrid, and multicloud deployments. 

[OKD](https://okd.io/) is a community distribution of Kubernetes optimized for continuous application development and multi-tenant deployment. OKD adds developer and operations-centric tools on top of Kubernetes to enable rapid application development, easy deployment and scaling, and long-term lifecycle maintenance for small and large teams.

[Odo](https://odo.dev/) is a fast, iterative, and straightforward CLI tool for developers who write, build, and deploy applications on Kubernetes and OpenShift.

[Kata Operator](https://github.com/openshift/kata-operator) is an operator to perform lifecycle management (install/upgrade/uninstall) of [Kata Runtime](https://katacontainers.io/) on Openshift as well as Kubernetes cluster.

[Thanos](https://thanos.io/) is a set of components that can be composed into a highly available metric system with unlimited storage capacity, which can be added seamlessly on top of existing Prometheus deployments.

[OpenShift Hive](https://github.com/openshift/hive) is an operator which runs as a service on top of Kubernetes/OpenShift. The Hive service can be used to provision and perform initial configuration of OpenShift 4 clusters.

[Rook](https://rook.io/) is a tool that turns distributed storage systems into self-managing, self-scaling, self-healing storage services. It automates the tasks of a storage administrator: deployment, bootstrapping, configuration, provisioning, scaling, upgrading, migration, disaster recovery, monitoring, and resource management.

[VMware Tanzu](https://tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu) is a centralized management platform for consistently operating and securing your Kubernetes infrastructure and modern applications across multiple teams and private/public clouds.

[Kubespray](https://kubespray.io/) is a tool that combines Kubernetes and Ansible to easily install Kubernetes clusters that can be deployed on [AWS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/blob/master/docs/aws.md), GCE, [Azure](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/blob/master/docs/azure.md), [OpenStack](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/blob/master/docs/openstack.md), [vSphere](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/blob/master/docs/vsphere.md), [Packet](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/blob/master/docs/packet.md) (bare metal), Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (Experimental), or Baremetal.

[KubeInit](https://github.com/kubeinit/kubeinit) provides Ansible playbooks and roles for the deployment and configuration of multiple Kubernetes distributions.

[Rancher](https://rancher.com/) is a complete software stack for teams adopting containers. It addresses the operational and security challenges of managing multiple Kubernetes clusters, while providing DevOps teams with integrated tools for running containerized workloads.

[K3s](https://github.com/rancher/k3s) is a highly available, certified Kubernetes distribution designed for production workloads in unattended, resource-constrained, remote locations or inside IoT appliances. 

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a Kubernetes Package Manager tool that makes it easier to install and manage Kubernetes applications.

[Knative](https://knative.dev/) is a Kubernetes-based platform to build, deploy, and manage modern serverless workloads. Knative takes care of the operational overhead details of networking, autoscaling (even to zero), and revision tracking. 

[KubeFlow](https://www.kubeflow.org/) is a tool dedicated to making deployments of machine learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable.

[Etcd](https://etcd.io/) is a distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data that needs to be accessed by a distributed system or cluster of machines. Etcd is used as the backend for service discovery and stores cluster state and configuration for Kubernetes.

[OpenEBS](https://openebs.io/) is a Kubernetes-based tool to create stateful applications using Container Attached Storage.

[Container Storage Interface (CSI)](https://www.architecting.it/blog/container-storage-interface/) is an API that lets container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes seamlessly communicate with stored data via a plug-in.

[MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io/) is a tool that delivers the full Kubernetes experience. In a Fully containerized deployment with compressed over-the-air updates for ultra-reliable operations. It is supported on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.

[Charmed Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes/features) is a well integrated, turn-key, conformant Kubernetes platform, optimized for your multi-cloud environments developed by Canonical.

[Grafana Kubernetes App](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/grafana-kubernetes-app) is a toll that allows you to monitor your Kubernetes cluster's performance. It includes 4 dashboards, Cluster, Node, Pod/Container and Deployment. It allows for the automatic deployment of the required Prometheus exporters and a default scrape config to use with your in cluster Prometheus deployment.

[KubeEdge](https://kubeedge.io/en/) is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge.It is built upon kubernetes and provides fundamental infrastructure support for network, app. deployment and metadata synchronization between cloud and edge.

[Lens](https://k8slens.dev/)  is the most powerful IDE for people who need to deal with Kubernetes clusters on a daily basis. It has support for MacOS, Windows and Linux operating systems.

[kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container “nodes”. It was primarily designed for testing Kubernetes itself, but may be used for local development or CI.

[Flux CD](https://fluxcd.io/) is a tool that automatically ensures that the state of your Kubernetes cluster matches the configuration you've supplied in Git. It uses an operator in the cluster to trigger deployments inside Kubernetes, which means that you don't need a separate continuous delivery tool.

[Platform9 Managed Kubernetes (PMK)](https://platform9.com/managed-kubernetes/) is a Kubernetes as a service that ensures fully automated Day-2 operations with 99.9% SLA on any environment, whether in data-centers, public clouds, or at the edge.
